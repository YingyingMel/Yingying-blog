Things became quite difficult for working parents to juggle career and family, especially during the pandemic. So I decided to take a break from work and enjoyed the time being with my kids. As kids grew up and started going to childcare, I got plenty of my time. This is where I consciously decided to take up programming. I had some experience with it during my PhD studying, but I never truly grasped the power of what you can do with programming, nor had the passion for it. However, that quickly changed as I began to study and eventually created some practical programs. When things started to make more and more sense, this is where I really started becoming passionate about programing and seriously thinking about a career transition.

The programming languages and skills I have learned are shown at your left-hand side. I built this blog for showing my projects, which includes a login/register system, 3 apps and a backend server. More projects will be added once I finish. If you have any suggestions for me, welcome to leave a message at the diary page. Thank you very much. "})]})})]})]})}}}]);
